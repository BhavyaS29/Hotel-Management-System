# Hotel Management System

## Project Overview
The **Hotel Management System** is a C++-based application that simulates essential hotel operations, including room reservations, restaurant ordering, and customer billing. By combining room and restaurant management within a single platform, it provides a cohesive and streamlined system for both hotel staff and guests. Through a console-based interface, users can book rooms, order food, request services, receive invoices, and provide feedback, optimizing hotel operations. The system is designed with modular classes representing rooms, dishes, customers, and employees to capture the real-world dynamics of a hotel environment.

## Project Description
This project models a fully functional hotel management environment by organizing critical operations into a structured and user-friendly application. Key features include room booking, restaurant menu viewing and ordering, bill management, and feedback logging for service improvement. Customers can book a room, browse the restaurant menu, place orders, and manage payments, while employees handle service requests and assist guests as needed. The program leverages file handling for persistent data storage and incorporates exception handling for effective error management, creating a practical, maintainable solution suitable for small to medium-sized hotel operations.
## Hardware Requirements
This project doesnâ€™t have specific hardware requirements, but the following minimum system configuration is recommended for development and testing:

- **Processor**: Intel i3 or equivalent
- **RAM**: 4 GB
- **Storage**: 100 MB free space (for saving customer data and logs)
- **Operating System**: Any OS that supports C++ development (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Software Requirements
- **Compiler**: A C++ compiler such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Visual Studio C++.
- **IDE**: Any C++ IDE like Visual Studio Code, CLion, Code::Blocks, or a text editor with terminal access for compilation.
- **Libraries Used**: Standard C++ libraries (`iostream`, `string`, `fstream`) and basic I/O libraries.

## Usage
To use the hotel management system:

1. **Compile and Run**: Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ hotel_management.cpp -o hotel_management`) and run it in the terminal.
2. **Choose Operation**: Users can choose options for accommodation or dining, which guides them through various hotel services like room booking or ordering food.
3. **Interact with System**: Customers and employees interact with the system to fulfill their roles in room booking, order placement, and service requests.
4. **Receive Invoices and Give Feedback**: After completing services, customers can get their bills and provide feedback, which is saved for future improvements.
